Chess exercises organizer

Load your chess exercises from PGN files, and train yourself against the device.

First, at least in the first launch, you have to select the path to the chess UCI engine (such as Stockfish),
on your computer. This engine will be responsible for making the best computer moves.

Then, when requesting a game start :
1. Either you select the PGN file which has the exercises : 
for each game you give the startup position with a FEN tag 
(e.g: [FEN "rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2"]).
Or you define the startup position with the editor.
2. Then you select your player type for both sides (Human/Computer), as well as the timing or game without time limit.
3. You play and can stop the game even if it is not finished by the rules.
4. You can review the game in the notation view.
